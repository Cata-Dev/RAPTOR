A TypeScript implementation of [RAPTOR algorithm](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/trsc.2014.0534).
It includes the following derivatives:

- RAPTOR
- McRAPTOR

All optimizations are included except _local pruning_ ; see [this issue](https://github.com/Cata-Dev/RAPTOR/issues/63).
It is implemented on the [local-pruning branch](https://github.com/Cata-Dev/RAPTOR/tree/local-pruning)

## What it is

An algorithm to compute all Pareto-optimal journeys in a dynamic public transit network for multiple criteria, such as arrival time and number of transfers.

Implemented criteria at [src/criteria.ts](./src/criteria.ts):

- **Foot distance**, minimizes the foot distance over a journey
- **Buffer time** (same as the original paper), maximizes the minimum transfer time to hop on a trip over a journey
- **Success probability**, relative to how connection times intersect

## Additions

Some new features are brought in this implementation:

- Enhancing Pareto front to be maximal in general (with any criterion) â€” [issue](https://github.com/Cata-Dev/RAPTOR/issues/216), [PR](https://github.com/Cata-Dev/RAPTOR/pull/217)  
  This is done by scanning subsequent catchable trips, not only the earliest one.
  The scanning stops when its label is dominated by one of a previously scanned trip.
  This implies the Pareto front is maximal if every criterion is increasing for increasing trips.
- Generalizing the time type.
  It can be a scalar, an interval.
- Ability to run multiple queries (multiple RAPTOR instances, in fact) in parallel, reading the same RAPTOR data (memory chunk).
  This is done thanks to a [SharedArrayBuffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer) together with powerful [views](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DataView).
  There is a little overhead due to the views.
